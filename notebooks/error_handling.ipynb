    "## Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Errprs and exceptions are a common part of programming. In Python, exceptions are raised when the interpreter detects an error in the code. When an exception is raised, the program stops executing and an error message is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax errors\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur when the code is not written correctly. For example, if you forget to close a parenthesis, you will get a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions occur when the code is syntactically correct, but something goes wrong during execution. For example, if you try to divide by zero, you will get a ZeroDivisionError.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle exceptions in Python, you can use the try-except block. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block contains the code that handles the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 1 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python program that calculates the average of the numbers in the list. If the list is empty, the program should print \"List is empty\" and return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should handle the following exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ZeroDivisionError: If the list is empty, the program should print \"List is empty\" and return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TypeError: If the list contains any non-numeric values, the program should print \"List contains non-numeric values\" and return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_average(numbers):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    total = sum(numbers)\n",
    "    average = total / len(numbers)\n",
    "    return average\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- The average of the numbers in the list."

    "\n",
    "The following code contains two functions: `divide` and `calculate_average`. The `divide` function takes two numbers as input and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number. The `calculate_average` function takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the average of the numbers in the list by calling the `divide` function.\n",
